# Acknowledgements
- My brother for coming up with the idea of a "radar" to intuitively track drum rhythm patterns.
- [Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/) and especially his [polar clock examples](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1096355), which served as inspiration for this project.
- [Lou Montulli](http://www.montulli.org/lou) for building [GrooveScribe](https://github.com/montulli/GrooveScribe) which is what rhythm-radar uses for playback and track editing.

# Contributions
