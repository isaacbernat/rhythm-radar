# rhythm-radar
Experiments on rhythm visualisations with [d3.js](https://d3js.org/).

A Proof of Concept may be tried live [here](http://isaacbernat.github.io/rhythm-radar/?TimeSig=4/4&Div=16&Tempo=100&Measures=1&H=|xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-|&S=|----O-------O---|&K=|o-------o-------|&T1=|---o---oo-------|&T4=|---o---oo-------|).

# Acknowledgements
- My brother for coming up with the idea of a "radar" to intuitively track drum rhythm patterns.
- [Mike Bostock](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/) and especially his [polar clock examples](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1096355), which served as inspiration for this project.
- [Lou Montulli](http://www.montulli.org/lou) for building [GrooveScribe](https://github.com/montulli/GrooveScribe) which is what rhythm-radar uses for playback and track editing.

# TODOs
- instead of using straight-line segments to link nodes use curves following the pattern of the corresponding circular coloured "lane".
