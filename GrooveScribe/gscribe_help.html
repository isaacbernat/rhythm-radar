<h3>Metronome</h3>

Options:
<ul>
<li><b>4ths</b> - adds a cowbell on the 1 and a click on the 2, 3, and 4;
<li><b>8ths</b> - Adds a click on all the "ands"   (plays 8th note triplets in triplet subdivisions)
<li><b>16ths</b> - Adds a softer click on every 16th note.  Plays a louder click on the 2, 3, and 4.  (plays 16th note triplets in triplet subdivisions)
<li><b>Solo</b> - Plays the metronome, and mutes the groove when the play button is pressed.
<li><b>Auto Speed Up</b> - Will increase the metronome BPM automatically after each loop through.
<li><b>Offset click</b> - Allows the metronome to accent the "e", "&amp;", or "a", instead of the 1.
</ul>

<h3>What swing is "correct" or "normal"?</h3>
There is no "correct" value for swing.   The level of swing varies widely and generally left to the performer to determine.    <br>
The classic triplet swing feel shows up at 33% on the swing meter. For a tighter swing feel (dotted 8th followed by 16th) move the meter to 50%, full swing. 
Swing is a matter of personal taste so please feel free to practice your grooves with different amounts of swing until you find the feel that you are looking for.   <br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(jazz_performance_style)">Wikipedia has a good article on the types of swing.</a>  (Scroll down to the "Types" header)   <br>

<h3>Permutations</h3>

A permutation for drumming is a method for playing all the possible combinations of given instrument for a note division.   
The Groove Scribe can generate two types of permutations:  Kick drum and snare drum permutations in 1/16th notes.    
<p>
If there are multiple measures present, all but the first will be closed when a permutation is activated.   
You can use the "Undo" action in the help menu to restore the measures that were closed if necessary.
<p>
<b>Permutation Options</b>
<ul>
	Count in 1 measure
	<ul><li>Plays the metronome for 4 counts before starting the permutation
	</ul>

	Simplify multiple kicks
	<ul><li>Causes the kick on the "1" and the "1e" to be skipped if it 
	directly follows a kick on the "4a" from the previous measure.   This usually makes the flow better if you are playing the whole 
	pattern all the way through.
	</ul>

	Use Accent Grid
	<ul><li>Changes the permutation to use all the 16ths notes on the snare and to accent the permutation pattern.
	</ul>

	Ostinato, Singles, Doubles, Triples, etc...
	<ul><li>Any Individual permutation section can be turned on and off.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h3>Editing tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>The "Hi-hat", "Snare", "Kick" and "Sticking" labels to the left of the editing grid have a menu when clicked.   You can quickly turn all the notes in a measure on or off using the menu.
<li>Right click the notes to access special notes, like ghost notes, hi-hat open, and flams.    On a touch device, use the "Advanced Edit" button to access the special notes.
<li>Use the Grooves menu to select a groove close to the one you want, or use it to clear the editing grid to start a new groove from scratch.
<li>You can change the notes while playing the groove and hear what you are doing while editing.
